# NN2ST
Two-Sample Test with Nearest Neighbors Density Ratio Estimation

NN2ST is a Python code to perform Two-Sample (a.k.a. Homogeneity) test of two data samples
using the method of density ratio estimation with Nearest Neighbors.

## Get Started

The source code is fully contained in the file NN2ST.py.

The default data are synthethic random samples generated from 2-dimensional gaussians.

The code can be easily adapted to input data of any dimension from external files.
