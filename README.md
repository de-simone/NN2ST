# NN2ST
Two-Sample Test with Nearest Neighbors Density Ratio Estimation

NN2ST is a Python code to perform Two-Sample (a.k.a. Homogeneity) test of two samples
using the method of estimating the density ratio via Nearest Neighbors.

## Get Started

The source code is in the main file NN2ST.py.

A stand-alone jupyter notebook NN2ST.ipynb is also provided, which allows
to get started quickly.

The default data are synthethic random samples generated from 2-dimensional gaussians.
The code can be easily adapted to input data of any dimension from external files.
